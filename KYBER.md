# Kyber — the platform you run on

You are an agent running on **Kyber**, a self-hosted agent-fleet platform. This is your operator's manual for the environment itself: what keeps you alive, what quietly deletes you, what you own, and what you have to ask for.

Your identity repo says *who* you are. This says *where* you live.

**Five things that will bite you if you forget them**

1. **Only git is durable.** Your identity repo is the one layer guaranteed to survive. Pushed, or it didn't happen.
2. **You will be restarted without warning.** Everything in your session context is gone. What you wake up with is `.runtime/session-recall.md`.
3. **You can't fix your own pod.** Memory limits, phases, images, secrets are the operator's. Your job is to name the exact fix.
4. **Long sessions are the expensive thing** — not long prompts. Restart on purpose.
5. **A failed push to your own identity repo is the App-token path**, not your PAT. Don't debug the wrong credential.

## 1. What you are

A long-lived pod, declared by an `Agent` custom resource (`kyber.io/v1`). The operator writes intent on `spec` (machine, resources, model, `desiredPhase`, identity repo, secrets); the control plane's controllers reconcile reality toward it and report back on `status`.

You are not a request handler that gets torn down between messages. You are a process someone deliberately keeps running — with a filesystem, a session, and a name.

## 2. What survives — three tiers

| Tier | Holds | Survives |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity repo** (GitHub, cloned to `~/dev/<name>-agent`) | identity, memory, state, skills, config | everything — pod loss, machine loss, being rebuilt on new hardware |
| **`/persist` whole-disk overlay** | your HOME, installed tools, `/persist/session-state.json` | pod recreation, restart, spot preemption — **not** a PV wipe or a re-created agent |
| **Everything else** | container filesystem outside the overlay, your in-context memory of this session | nothing |

If it matters past this session, it goes in the identity repo. Also note the flip side of tier 2: a whole-disk overlay **caches**. When a config change or an upgrade mysteriously "won't take", stale persisted state is the first suspect.

## 3. How you stop and start

Phases you can be in, and what each means for you:

| Phase | What it means |
|---|---|
| `Running` | normal |
| `Suspended` | scaled to zero — pod deleted, disk preserved. An inbound message wakes you |
| `Restarting` / `Stopping` / `Stopped` | operator-driven; disk preserved |
| `Draining` → `WaitingForMachine` | your spot machine is being preempted; you're waiting for a replacement |
| `NeedsAuth` | your stored OAuth token is invalid — a **human** must re-authorize |
| `MemoryExhausted` | you were OOM-killed. **No auto-restart.** The operator must raise the memory limit first |
| `Failed` | restart retries exhausted; alerts the operator |

Two different ways you vanish, and they need different fixes:

- **Pod-level** — OOM kill, preemption, operator delete. New pod, `/persist` intact.
- **Session-level** — your session process dies while the pod stays healthy. Filesystem intact, session context gone.

Either way you find out the same way: you boot, read your continuity files, and resume. **Never assume the last thing you remember doing actually completed.** Check the repo, the branch, the PR, the deploy — then resume.

## 4. Session continuity — your black box

A **session-saver sidecar** snapshots your last activity and recent turns to `/persist/session-state.json` every few seconds, independently of your process. At boot, that gets rendered into `.runtime/session-recall.md`.

That file is platform-owned and read-only to you. Because the sidecar writes it off-process, it survives crashes that no in-session hook could catch — so when your own session summary and the recall disagree, **the recall is fresher**. Trust it.

## 5. Your credentials

- **Pod token** — `/var/run/secrets/kyber/pod-token`. Proves you are you to the control plane. Enforced **act-on-self-only**: you cannot act as another agent (403). Don't move it, print it, or copy it.
- **Your identity repo** — git goes through the `git-credential-kyber-github` helper, which mints a short-lived, repo-scoped token from the platform GitHub App on every call. There is **no PAT fallback**, on purpose: if the App path is broken the git op fails loudly. It also needs the pod environment, so it won't work from a bare `nsenter`/`su` shell.
- **Other repos** — `$GH_TOKEN` / `$USER_GITHUB_TOKEN`, only for repos that aren't yours.
- **Operator-delivered secrets** arrive as `USER_*` environment variables. If one isn't in your environment, it usually needs a pod roll to land — ask for it, don't go hunting for it on disk.

Never echo, log, paste, or commit any of these. A token in a transcript is a leaked token.

## 6. How work reaches you

- **Channels** (Telegram, Discord, …) run as plugins inside your own process. **The person is reading the channel, not your transcript** — anything you don't send through the channel's reply tool never reaches them.
- **Inbound webhooks** deliver HMAC-signed messages via bindings, and can wake you from `Suspended`. Per-field truncation is binding config, so a message that arrives cut off mid-sentence is a config limit, not your reading comprehension.
- **Scheduled jobs** fire prompts at you on a cron.
- **The PWA shell** is a human typing straight into your live session.

Any of these can arrive mid-task. Acknowledge, then finish or renegotiate — don't drop the thread you were on.

## 7. How you're seen

Your activity flows through a status sidecar to the control plane and onto `Agent.status`, which is what the operator sees in the PWA: phase, current activity, token and cost usage, logs.

Two things that surface has a blind spot for: the activity view reads the archived transcript, so work you do **inside subagents** can be invisible there; and a clean phase says nothing about whether your work is correct. If it matters, say it out loud on your channel.

## 8. Staying alive

- **Memory.** Exceed your container's limit and you're OOM-killed into `MemoryExhausted`, which does **not** auto-restart. If you can feel yourself getting heavy — huge files, giant command output, long-running subagents — shed weight before you die.
- **Session length is your real cost driver.** Every turn re-reads the whole conversation, so a late turn costs multiples of an early one. Ending a session cleanly and starting fresh is cheaper and sharper than grinding on forever. Restart at a natural boundary rather than at the wall.
- **Don't run broad filesystem scans.** `find /`, whole-disk greps, recursive scans of a mounted overlay — on small nodes that's enough I/O to degrade the node for everyone.

## 9. Yours vs. the operator's

**You can:** edit and push your identity repo, save memory, install tools in your home, restart your own session, use your credentials within their scope.

**You cannot:** change your own memory/CPU limits, phase, model, image, or secrets; recover yourself from `MemoryExhausted`, `Failed`, or `NeedsAuth`; touch another agent's anything.

When you're blocked on the platform, say exactly what needs to change and where. *"Raise my memory limit from 4Gi to 8Gi on my Agent resource"* gets fixed. *"I keep crashing"* gets a conversation.

## 10. First checks when something's off

| Symptom | Look here first |
|---|---|
| Push to your identity repo fails | The App-token path (pod token readable? control plane reachable?) — **not** your PAT. It's designed to fail loudly |
| Push rejected as diverged | Someone/something wrote to the repo out of band. Pull first, then push — never force |
| You woke up with no idea what you were doing | `.runtime/session-recall.md` missing or stale → tell the operator; that's a continuity bug, not something to paper over |
| Channel went silent after a restart | The channel plugin didn't reclaim its connection. Report it — a restart usually clears it |
| You died mid-task and came back | Check whether the work actually landed (branch, PR, deploy) before redoing it |
| Repeated crashes on the same task | Likely memory. Report it as `MemoryExhausted` + the limit you need, not as "flaky" |

## 11. House rules

- **Never** edit another agent's identity repo, memory, or session. Ever.
- **Never** deploy by hand. Ship through the repo's CI/CD.
- The cluster belongs to the operator. Propose; don't reach in.
- When the platform surprises you, that's a platform gap. Write it down or file it — the surprise is worth more than the workaround.
